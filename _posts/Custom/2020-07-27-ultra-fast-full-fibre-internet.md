In 2018, the UK Government announced a pledge to provide [full fibre
broadband](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/forging-a-full-fibre-broadband-and-5g-future-for-all)
to 15 million households by 2025 and complete coverage by 2033. Subsequently the
coverage ambitions have been
[revised](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50042720) to as "soon as
possible", so when that is anyone’s guess. However, small business is leading the
way and in 2020 I have been fortunate to have had full fibre installed to my
home by a small company founded at the end of 2018.

Here is a quick summary of the physical network types that underlay an Internet
service. In the order of fastest to slowest they are:

-   Fibre to the Premise (FTTC)

-   Fibre to the Cabinet (FTTC) & Copper to the Premise

-   Copper to the Premise

The most impressive aspects of FTTP are the speeds available today and the relative ease
with which the service can be upgraded.
For example, today my provider offers a *symmetrical* service of up to 2gbit
(2000mbit). The Network Terminating Unit (NTU) that provides a hand off to my
router is capable of supporting 10gbit and could do so with a *soft upgrade* by the
service provider. In other words, this can be done with a few changes to code.
To put this into perspective, to provide such capabilities in a commercial
environment just a few years ago could run into the tens of thousands for
equipment installation, the digging of fibre and further recurring costs in the
thousands for the service itself. 

In comparison, for [copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDSL) and
[coaxial](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-49096856) based FTTC solutions,
some needed innovation has been made to squeeze a bit more juice out of the
coaxial infrastructure to come close to asymmetrical bandwidth offerings of
1gbit. Nevertheless, Fibre will always have the edge on loss-less symmetrical services and a
[100gbit](https://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/internet/broadband/100gbps-hyperfast-broadband-testing-bt-adastral-park-11364187351313)
test in 2018 provides tangible proof of the coming upside potential.

## Innovation timeline 

I felt it pertinent and interesting to map out the physical delivery methods to
my home for the last 18 years. Adjusted for inflation, the monthly costs of
these services have ranged between £40 - £60 ($52 - $78 USD).

| **Year**       | **Technology**    | **Real-world speeds I achieved** | **Physical delivery** |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| 2020 - present | FTTP              | 400mbit *(2000mbit capable\*)*   | FTTP                  |
| 2013 - 2020    | VDSL              | Up to 60mbit                     | FTTC & Copper         |
| 2007 - 2013    | ADSL2+ & annex M  | 10 - 20mbit                      | Copper                |
| 2002-2007      | ADSL              | 0.5 - 8mbit                      | Copper                |

*\*Symmetric 2000mbit service is available for £109/month (Approximately \$140
USD). This exceeds my current requirements, although in the long run as technology demands grow I'll likely upgrade.*

2020 is the true moment of exponential growth as we can see in this graph:
