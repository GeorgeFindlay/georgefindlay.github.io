This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted with [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the content is rendered with
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

In the 1990s, *static* websites were all the rage. Anyone that learned
[HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) could put a basic website together.

In the 2000s, *dynamic* server-side websites became the thing. As it happens,
between 03 - 06 I was involved in
[phpWebThings](https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpwebthings/) a content
management system. This made it possible for ordinary people to build feature
rich websites without HTML knowledge. Then WordPress came along and led the way.
Still, a few tech skills were needed to pull either setup off.

Fast forward to 2020 and it is much easier to build a website without coding or
tech knowledge.

Writing content using Markdown is as easy as following this [Markdown
reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/contribute/markdown-reference).
Alternatively, you can write using one of these methods:

-   Write in [Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word) and save
    using a [Markdown plugin](https://www.writage.com/)

-   Write in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs?dv=win) and
    leverage the [Docs Markdown
    Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=docsmsft.docs-markdown)

Or there is
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=markdown+how+to) to get
you started. Good luck!
