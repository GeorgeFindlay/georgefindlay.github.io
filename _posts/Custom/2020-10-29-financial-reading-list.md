In recent times I have been seeking to better understand the global financial
system and upcoming financial innovation. Here are a small selection of links
that I have found helpful in enhancing my understanding so far.

## Payment, clearing and settlement systems

-   BIS Red Book [Volume 1](https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d97.htm) published
    September 2011

>   *Coverage: Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Korea, Mexico, Russia,
>   Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland.*

-   BIS Red Book [Volume 2](https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d105.htm) published

>   Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the

    terms](https://www.bis.org/dcms/glossary/glossary.pdf?scope=CPMI&base=term)
    used in payments and settlement systems

will be replaced in 2021 with a new High-Value payments system called

that leverages the global IOS 20022 [message
specifications](https://www.payments.ca/resources/iso-20022-resource-centre/technical-documentation).
Consider the Red Books a starting point.
