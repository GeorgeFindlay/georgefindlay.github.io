In 2019 I enrolled in my first [Harvard Business School Online
course](https://online.hbs.edu/) and since then I have been invited to
participate in several [HBS case
studies](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/academic-experience/Pages/the-hbs-case-method.aspx).

A typical HBS case is a 10-20-page document written from the perspective of a
real individual in a real organisation facing a real-life challenge.

The case method is all about you putting yourself in the shoes of the [case
protagonist](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/blog/post/case-protagonists-at-hbs) where
you are faced with leadership situations that involve making time sensitive
decisions with limited information. A key part of the learning experience is the
discussion with peers where questions are asked, observations made, and
positions shared. It is up to you to listen carefully and reflect on lessons
learned in the class.

The HBS [Take a Seat in the Harvard MBA Case
Classroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7iwXvBnbIE) video provides a great
insight into the case method.

I look forward to continuing life-long learning and hope to embark on an
[executive education
track](https://www.exed.hbs.edu/comprehensive-leadership-programs?program=comprehensive-leadership-programs)
in my future career travels.

Below is an outline of the cases I have participated in or observed either
onsite at Harvard Business School or remotely.
